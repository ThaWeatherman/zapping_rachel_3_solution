fringe case:
    calls one number once

robo callers tend to call lots of numbers only once or twice. lots means 6 or more people (however there still are a lot that call only 3-4 people)
    however there seem to also be some robots that call the same number 6+ times

normal callers mostly only call one or two numbers a small amount of A LOT

there are still some exceptions to the general trend

separating on area code is not helpful

between 4 am and noon there are next to no robo calls
within same minute to same area code + first 3 digits then robo
